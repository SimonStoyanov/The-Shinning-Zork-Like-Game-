A Zork-Like Game","tagline":"","body":"# The Shinning: A Zork-Like Game\r\nThis is the web page for The Shinning.\r\n\r\nThe game makes you search for objects, enter dungeons, act with people and (sometimes) fight with enemies, all in a 3rd person narration. The goal is to know what produced the shinning and if it is a menace to humanity, defeat it. Your actions have consequences in this game, you do not have to kill if it is not required.\r\n\r\nLink to the map: https://github.com/SimonStoyanov/The_Shinning.Zork-Like_Game/wiki/2.-The-World\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
